# Project Overview

This is a 2D side-scrolling game being developed in Rust using the Bevy game engine. The goal is to create a game with a player character that can move, jump, and attack enemies, with sprite-based animations for characters and effects. The project is set up to be developed within a dev container.

# Building and Running

To build and run the project, use the following Cargo command:

```sh
cargo run
```

*TODO: Add instructions for running the game with GUI support from the dev container, as this requires X11 forwarding.*

# Development Conventions

*   **Language:** Rust
*   **Game Engine:** Bevy
*   **Code Style:** Follow standard Rust conventions and formatting (e.g., using `cargo fmt`).
*   **Testing:** *TODO: Define a testing strategy for the game.*
